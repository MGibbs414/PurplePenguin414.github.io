To say this class is going well for me would just be a lie. I understand that this work will probably receive no points for it. 
However, I have decided that my lack of knowledge about JavaFX is not something I will be able to catch up on in this course. 
It may be best that I withdrawal but I would like your opinion on if I have a chance still to pass the course at all.
