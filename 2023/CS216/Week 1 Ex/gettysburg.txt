FOURSCORE AND SEVEN YEARS AGO OUR FATHERS BROUGHT FORTH UPON THIS 
CONTINENT A NEW NATION, CONCEIVED IN LIBERTY AND DEDICATED TO THE 
PROPOSITION THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL.  NOW WE ARE ENGAGED IN A 
GREAT CIVIL WAR, TESTING WHETHER THAT NATION, OR ANY NATION SO CONCEIVED 
AND SO DEDICATED, CAN LONG ENDURE.  WE ARE MET ON A GREAT BATTLEFIELD OF 
THAT WAR.  WE ARE MET TO DEDICATE A PORTION OF IT AS THE FINAL RESTING PLACE 
OF THOSE WHO HERE GAVE THEIR LIVES THAT THAT NATION MIGHT LIVE.  IT IS 
ALTOGETHER FITTING AND PROPER THAT WE SHOULD DO THIS.  BUT IN A LARGER SENSE 
WE CANNOT DEDICATE, WE CANNOT CONSECRATE, WE CANNOT HALLOW THIS GROUND.  
THE BRAVE MEN, LIVING AND DEAD, WHO STRUGGLED HERE, HAVE CONSECRATED IT 
FAR ABOVE OUR POOR POWER TO ADD OR DETRACT.  THE WORLD WILL LITTLE NOTE, 
NOR LONG REMEMBER, WHAT WE SAY HERE, BUT IT CAN NEVER FORGET WHAT THEY 
DID HERE.  IT IS FOR US, THE LIVING, RATHER, TO BE DEDICATED HERE TO THE 
UNFINISHED WORK THAT THEY HAVE THUS FAR SO NOBLY CARRIED ON.  IT IS RATHER 
FOR US TO BE HERE DEDICATED TO THE GREAT TASK REMAINING BEFORE US, THAT 
FROM THESE HONORED DEAD WE TAKE INCREASED DEVOTION TO THAT CAUSE FOR 
WHICH THEY HERE GAVE THE LAST FULL MEASURE OF DEVOTION; THAT WE HERE 
HIGHLY RESOLVE THAT THESE DEAD SHALL NOT HAVE DIED IN VAIN; THAT THE NATION 
SHALL, UNDER GOD, HAVE A NEW BIRTH OF FREEDOM; AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE, SHALL NOT PERISH FROM THE 
EARTH.
